# DarbotLabs Copilot Instructions

Welcome to DarbotLabs! This repository contains research and development for the Darbot framework and related technologies.

## Project Overview

DarbotLabs is a novel framework focused on:
- **Decentralized Autonomous Research BOT (Darbot)**
- **Darbot Language Model (DarbotLM/DLM)**
- **Darbot Language Model Context Protocol (DLMCP)**
- **Darbot Language Manifest Control Protocol**

Key components include:
- Darbot Framework and tooling
- Bounded Orchestration Taproot (BOT)
- Bridge Orchestration Transformers
- Modular Efficient Memory Language Model (MEMLM)
- Various Darbot derivatives (darbot-browser, darbot-windows, darbot-coder, darbot-cli, etc.)

## Important Notes

- This is a **prototype** using GenLM framework with continuous machine learning R&D
- Code is **not intended for public consumption**
- Everything should be used in **isolated environments by experienced engineers**
- No explicit or implied warranties are provided

## Guidelines for Contributors

### Code Style
- Keep code simple and readable
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Document complex logic and novel approaches

### Development Principles
- Prioritize research and experimentation
- Focus on modularity and reusability
- Consider decentralized and autonomous design principles
- Think about bounded orchestration patterns

### File Organization
- Keep repository structure minimal and clean
- Document new frameworks or tools in the README
- Use descriptive names for new Darbot derivatives

### Commits
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Group related changes together
- Reference any related research or documentation

## Technology Stack

Currently a minimal repository with:
- HTML/Web content (index.html)
- Documentation (README.md)
- License file

When adding new technologies, consider the Darbot framework principles and maintain compatibility with the overall vision of decentralized autonomous research systems.
